This notebook will show many techniques based on Computer Vision.

# Colour spaces: from RGB to LAB
The RGB space is not perceptually uniform. As such, the proximity of colours in RGB colour space does not indicate colour similarity. Since RGB is complete, other complete colour spaces are generated by transforming RGB, which is not necessarily a linear transform. Hence LAB colour space is  used 

# Gaussian Filter: 
It is used to smoothen/blur the images by removing noise. We have used different weight kernels in X-Y direction.

# Histogram: 
The distributions of colours in a image is shown by Histogram. A histogram of theÂ pixel intensity values in 2d space is given below

# Back Projection: 
A technique to find areas in our original image which has same colour distribution as in cropped image. Back Projection is a way of recording how well the pixels of a given image fit the distribution of pixels in a histogram model.
For Back Projection, we calculate the histogram model of a feature and then use it to find this feature in an image.

# Histogram Equalisation:
It is done to improve contrast of an image since few pixel values are confined to some specific ranges only and HE
will make pixel values more equal across the board.

# PCA:
Transformation of a high dimensional vector space into a low dimensional space.
